You can get all the results by directly running test.m. Setting variable myDir2 to 'input/' is to get the results for 2.1, and setting variable myDir2 to 'extracredits/' is to get the results for 2.2. test2.m is to get results using approach proposed by Hedau et al. ransac_vp.m is the function to calculate the vanishing points given lines. delete_inliers.m is to remove the inliers from the line segments. line_para.m is to get the homogenous representation of a line given two points. get_votes.m is the voting process of the algorithm.
